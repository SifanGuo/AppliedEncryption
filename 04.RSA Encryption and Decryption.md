# RSA Encryption and Decryption
For this script you will be both Alice and Bob. I will provide P, Q and e.

For the Bob half of your script, you will encrypt any message. I want this script to be able to handle messages that are longer than PQ. To do that I suggest splitting the message into smaller chunks based on the size of PQ, then encrypting the chunks individually. The ciphertext variable C of each chunk can then be appended to a list to later be handled iteratively. Make sure to print C (or your list of Cs) before moving on to the Alice half of the script.

For the Alice half of the script, you should take the encrypted message from Bob, calculate your decipher variable d, and print out the decrypted message.

Here is a sample input (P, Q, and e are on line 1, 2, and 3 respectively):RSAinput.txt




Extra Credit:

For extra credit, utilize the Fermat Primality Test we covered this week (along with a random number generator of your choice) to generate your own primes.  You will then generate your own P, Q and e to feed into the main assignment.
